     * BFS (Breadth First Search)
     *
     * Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or Graph data structures.
     * It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a Graph,sometimes referred to as a 'search key'),
     * and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
     * It uses the opposite strategy as depth-first search,
     * which instead explores the highest-depth nodes first before being forced to backtrack and expand shallower nodes.
     * BFS and its application in finding connected components of graphs were invented in 1945 by Konrad Zuse,
     * in his (rejected) Ph.D.
     * thesis on the Plankalkül programming language,
     * but this was not published until 1972.
     * It was reinvented in 1959 by Edward F.
     * Moore, who used it to find the shortest path out of a maze,
     * and later developed by C. Y.
     * Lee into a wire routing algorithm (published 1961).
